# Personal Info
I am currently an Professor in School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong Normal University(山东师范大学). I obtained my BA and MA degree in 1984 and 1991 from Tianjin University, under the supervision of Prof. Zhongshan Wei. I then joined Shandong Normal University in February, 1991. I obtained my PHD degree in 2002 from the Computing Institute of the Chinese Academy. I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Postdoctoral Station of Shandong University, in 2009. My current research interests include machine learning, data mining, bioinformatics and social computing.
